# Bulma-Test
This is basically me testing out the bulma framework. It's not really a formal project. It's based on Traversy Media's tutorial, which is why it looks familiar. So, I was just rewriting the code in order to gain a better understanding of Bulma.

Note: The navbar class has changed since the code was originally written (for the tutorial). So, the navbar used in this test is outdated compared to the new version of Bulma. However, I didn't change it since the purpose of the project was still achieved.
